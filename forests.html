                    <h2>What Is Deforestation</h2>
                    <p>Forests are being cleared at a pace that the natural world cannot recover from. Deforestation happens when 
					large areas of trees are removed for farming, building, mining or logging. Once these trees are cut down, the 
					land loses the ability to support many species and the soil becomes weak and dry. 
					Forests that took centuries to grow can disappear in a matter of weeks, leaving long lasting damage behind.</p>

                    <h2>Why Forests Matter</h2>
                    <p>Forests play a vital role in keeping the planet healthy. They regulate temperature by storing carbon, which 
					slows down climate change. They protect soil from erosion and help to prevent flooding. They are also home to over 
					half of the world’s land based species. Many communities depend on forests for food, shelter and traditional 
					livelihoods. When forests are destroyed, these natural systems break down and the effects can be felt across the 
					world.</p>

                    <h2>The Main Causes of Forest Loss</h2>
                    <p>The biggest driver of forest loss today is agriculture. Land is often cleared for cattle farming, soy plantations 
					and palm oil production. Logging also removes huge numbers of trees for construction and furniture. Roads, mining 
					sites and expanding cities push deeper into natural areas each year. In some regions, rising temperatures and
					drought have caused more frequent wildfires, which quickly destroy habitats and are difficult to control.</p>
