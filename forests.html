                    <h2>What Is Deforestation</h2>
					<p>
					Deforestation happens when large areas of forest are cleared faster than they can naturally regrow. Trees are 
					removed for farming, building, mining and timber, leaving the land exposed and unable to support the same level 
					of life as before. Once these forests are gone, the soil becomes weak, wildlife loses its habitat and the landscape
					changes permanently. Although it is a global issue, Ireland has also felt the impact. The country was once almost 
					entirely covered in woodland, yet only a small amount of native forest remains today due to centuries of clearing 
					for agriculture and settlement.

                    <h2>Why Forests Matter</h2>
                    <p>
					Forests play a vital role in keeping environments stable and healthy. They store carbon and help slow the effects 
					of climate change. They protect soil from erosion, reduce flooding and hold huge amounts of biodiversity. Many 
					species depend on forests for food, shelter and breeding grounds. In Ireland, native woodlands support animals 
					such as red squirrels, pine martens and a wide range of birds and insects. These forests also help manage rainfall, 
					which is becoming more important as storms and heavy rain grow more frequent across the country.

                    <h2>The Main Causes of Forest Loss</h2>
                    <p>
					Forests are threatened for many reasons. Large areas are cleared for farming, livestock, logging and expanding 
					towns and cities. In other places, rising temperatures and drought lead to wildfires that spread quickly and are 
					difficult to control. While Ireland does not experience large scale tropical deforestation, it faces its own 
					challenges. Native woodland has been reduced over time, and in many areas it has been replaced with fast growing 
					commercial plantations that do not support the same range of species. Storm damage and land use change also 
					contribute to the loss of true native forest.
